# Naive Bayes Classifier from Scratch

## Introduction
This repo contains the implementations of Simple Naive Bayes Classifier and Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier. The implementations are for understanding how the algorithm works in detail. Not for production use. 

The derivations of the algorithms are in my Kaggle Notebook here https://www.kaggle.com/code/ugenteraan/a-study-on-simple-naive-bayes-classifier. Do check it out!
