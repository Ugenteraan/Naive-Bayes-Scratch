# Simple Naive Bayes Classifier from Scratch

## Introduction
The code provided in this repository is purely for learning purposes only. The implementation is made from the idea of Bayes Theorem and Naive Bayes. 

If you wish to know the derivation of Naive Bayes and how it was translated to the code in this repository, visit https://www.kaggle.com/code/ugenteraan/a-study-on-simple-naive-bayes-classifier.

## Dataset

This experiment was done on the Mushroom Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification. The main task here is to classify the mushrooms as poisonous ('p') or edible ('e') based on the given features about the mushroom.

## Result & Discussion

The Simple Naive Bayes Classifier achieved an accuracy of 99.7% in the test data. 30% of the data was randomly sampled to be the test data.
